    Linked List

    <pre>

      1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5
      
      1 <-- 2 <-- 3 <-- 4 <-- 5
      
      head 1 
      tail 5
      length 5
      
      head -> tail 
      tail -> head 
      tail 1 
      head 5

      Implement a member function called findMiddleNode() that finds and returns the middle node of the linked list.

Note: this LinkedList implementation does not have a length member variable.



Output:

Return the middle node of the linked list.

If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node (the one closer to the end).



Constraints:

You are not allowed to use any additional data structures (such as arrays) or modify the existing data structure.

You can only traverse the linked list once.





Example 1:

Suppose you have a LinkedList object, list, with the following values:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5


After calling the findMiddleNode() function:

let middle = list.findMiddleNode();
The middle node should have the value 3.





Example 2:

Now suppose you have a LinkedList object, list, with the following values:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6


After calling the findMiddleNode() function:

let middle = list.findMiddleNode();
The middle node should have the value 4.
